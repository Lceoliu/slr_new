# SignStream RVQ Project

This package contains a minimal implementation of the Stage 1 system
for the SignStream project. It provides data loading utilities for the
CSL-Daily dataset, a simple multi-level residual vector quantizer and a
training script that can run on a small subset of the data.

The structure roughly follows the project specification in `Rules.md`.
